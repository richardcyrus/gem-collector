# Crystals Collector

## Instructions

*   Display instructions on the page on how the game works.
*   Display four crystal buttons on the page.
*   Assign each button a random number between 1 and 12.
*   Do not display the value of each button on the page.
*   At the start of the game, show the player a random number between 19 and 120.
*   When the player clicks on one of the crystal buttons, add the point value of the button to the player's total score.
*   If the player's total score is equal to the number chosen by the computer, the player wins the game.
*   If the player's total score is more than the number chosen by the computer, the player loses the game.
*   After each win or loss, start a new game.
    -   When the game begins again, show a new number to the player.
    -   Assign new values to each of the crystal buttons.
    -   Reset the player's total score to zero.
*   Track and display the number of games won and loss.
*   The activities of the game -- choosing new numbers, assigning new values to the crystals, updating the score, updating the win/loss count, restarting the game -- should not trigger a full page refresh.
*   Use jQuery to complete the JavaScript/HTML updates.
